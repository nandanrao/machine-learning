This question is most easily explained by overlaying the PDF's of the two classes:

<<echo=false>>=
using Gadfly
using DataFrames

d = DataFrame(min = [0, 1], max = [2, 4], y = [1/2, 1/3], class = ["Class 0", "Class 1"])

plot(d, xmin="min", xmax="max", y = "y", label = "class",
     Geom.bar,
     Theme(default_color=colorant"rgba(220,130,50,0.5)"),
     Scale.x_continuous(minvalue = -1, maxvalue = 5),
     Scale.y_continuous(minvalue = 0, maxvalue = 1),
     Guide.xlabel(nothing),
     Guide.ylabel(nothing),
     Geom.label)

The bayes classifier is very simple, from 0-2, pick 0, while from 2-4, you pick 1. The Bayes risk is simply the overlapping area in the graph of the two PDF's. When values are between 1-2, there is a risk of 2/5. This is obtained by summing all the possibilities to obtain our marginilizing constant, and then taking the density of class 1 over the area (1/3):

\begin{align*}
\frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{2}{5}
\end{align*}
%
To compute the asymptotic 1-nearest neighbor risk, we imagine we have infinity observations. The nearest neighbor will therefore be picked out of a bag at random. In the area where the two classes overlap, there is a 3/5 chance of getting class 0 and a 2/5 chance of getting class 1. The risk is the expected loss, in the descrete case we sum over all the possiblities, multiplied by their probability, to get the expectation:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= \sum_x L(x)p(x) \\
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= \sum_{x \in L(x) \neq 0 } L(x)p(x) \\
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= 1*\eta(x)(1-\eta(x)) + 1*(1-\eta(x))\eta(x) \\
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= 2\eta(x)(1-\eta(x)) \\
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= 2(\frac{2}{5})(\frac{3}{5}) \\
\mathbb{E}(L_{1-nn}) &= \frac{12}{25}
\end{align*}
